# Forecasting sales and number of people (Traffic) in-store using ARIMA Model
Forecasting total sales and customer numbers in-store assists
in estimating a storeâ€™s profits and losses for a given period.
Estimating manually may be difficult because some days may
be different due to weather conditions and other factors we
may consider. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model is used in this paper to forecast future sales
(in-store sales in cents) and traffic (number of people in-store)
because its main purpose is to predict future values based on
past values
